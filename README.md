This is a group coursework that I did with my classmates during Masters's Degree. It is about HR data analysis.
The coursework' problems are:

Dr Hill has been moaned at by the CEO for his groupâ€™s relatively poor productivity and employee satisfaction over the past couple of years. He has always thought his 
staff took too many days off sick and that staff turnover was too high. He is now looking to your team to identify potential causes of poor productivity and 
engagement. He also read an article in the Financial Times that said something about the gender pay gap, and now he is concerned that his group might have whatever this gender 
pay gap thingy is. 

After doing some initial work with Dr Hill, your team has refined his general concerns into four specific questions:
1. What, if anything, increases the number of sick days that have been taken over
the past year?
2. What, if anything, increases the likelihood of someone leaving the 
organisation?
3. Are there any indicators of poor engagement scores?
4. Corrected for seniority, expertise and experience, do we have a gender pay 
gap

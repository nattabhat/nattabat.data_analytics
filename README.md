This is a group coursework that I did with my classmates during Masters's Degree. It is about HR data analysis.
The coursework include data cleansing, data analysis & visualization. All of them were done in R. After that, we
extracted useful insights and put them in Tableau Dashboard. I was in charge of Question1.

One company has poor productivity and employee satisfaction over the past couple of years. The CEO always thought his 
staff took too many days off sick and that staff turnover was too high. He is now looking to your team to identify potential causes of poor productivity and 
engagement. He also read an article in the Financial Times that said something about the gender pay gap, and now he is concerned that his group might have whatever this gender 
pay gap thingy is. 

After doing some initial work with CEO, your team has refined his general concerns into four specific questions:
1. What, if anything, increases the number of sick days that have been taken over the past year?
2. What, if anything, increases the likelihood of someone leaving the organisation?
3. Are there any indicators of poor engagement scores?
4. Corrected for seniority, expertise and experience, do we have a gender pay gap

Is there anything that increases the number of sick days in this company?
The answer is yes, there is, which is the number of special projects.

From my findings.
People who have done some special projects tend to have more sick days, but this trend could only apply to some departments, which are IT/IS, Admin Offices, and Software Engineering. The Production and Sales department also have a significant number of sick days too, there is a reason behind it and I will talk about it later.

My assumption for the theory is that special projects drive sick days because the employee who did the special project has to spend more time and effort to get it done. They might have to work overtime, have more stress, or not have lunch and dinner. All of these could lead to them getting sick.

For the production department, this company is an electrical product company. My assumption is their work is labor work, they might have to stand for hours without rest before finishing their shift, some of them could have back pain or health problems from doing that, so they took a leave

For the sales department, their work might involve traveling a lot because they have to sell the companyâ€™s products. So they might be exhausted or get sick from traveling from place to place.
